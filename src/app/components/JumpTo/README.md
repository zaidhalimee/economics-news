## Description

The JumpTo component serves as an in-page navigation menu, similar to a table of contents, allowing users to quickly jump to specific headings within an article. This component renders an `H2` heading, a list of anchor titles as `anchor` links, and groups them within a `navigation` landmark. When a link is actioned, the page scrolls down to the relevant heading, identified by matching anchor `ids`.

This component is typically used in articles with multiple headings, enhancing content findability by providing quick navigation options.
